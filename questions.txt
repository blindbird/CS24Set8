Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

The initial protection of a page should be PROT_NONE. If a segfault is gotten 
with this particular protection, then the page should be given read access, 
as the page is being accessed for the first time.

As the process is already in the virtual address space, then when the CPU calls 
the address to put into physical main memory ("mmap()"), the permission should 
be set to PROT_NONE. This will throw a segfault when anything tries to access 
it. This will be the first sign that the page of memory has been accessed. After
this first access, the permission can be changed to whatever is really needed
of that memory through "mprotect()". Then it can be learnt whether something has
tried to access the memory at least once by checking if the permission is not
PROT_NONE.


b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

If another segfault is gotten from the page, then the page is trying to be 
written to. This will be the first time that it is being written to, so you can
then set the bits as dirty.

A similar mechanism can be used to detect this situation. Depending on what the
memory allows, set the permissions using mprotect() only to whatever is needed
at the time. Only when a program want to write to memory should the permission 
be set to PROT_WRITE if the action is deemed possible by the constraints on the
memory. Then the pages can be checked for whether the permission is PROT_WRITE 
to know whether the page has been dirtied.


f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>>

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)
